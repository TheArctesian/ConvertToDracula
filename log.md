I was sitting in bed waiting for jetlag to put me to sleep, I was a couple wine bottles in so I thought I could, however I could not and wanted to make my dunst config. The template I found did not use dracula colors. Being a programer I did not want to go onto duck duck go and manually redo each one. I also wanted to do some CLI tools in rust and blazingly fast man released a video saying making CLI tools in rust will show you why it's great. Honestly have to agree, was a pain at first but very much enjoying the porecess. Obv I could make this in an hr in python, but learning manually error checking and type safety the rust way was really fun.
